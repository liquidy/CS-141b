Notes: We decided to use IP addresses for the lockedBy field. As Michael
mentioned in one of the answered questions on Moodle, it is difficult to
create a fully secure application without some sort of login or authentication
feature. However, we believe that using IP addresses provides a reasonable
way of identifying unique users, because it at least takes care of the case
when someone accidentally closes a tab or crashes their computer, and wishes
to reobtain the same document lock before the timeout ends. In this case, using
the IP address check allows that user to obtain the lock for the document
immediately without having to wait the entire timeout (which could be bad if
the timeout were on the scale of hours). It also allows us to do correct checks
for if a lock has expired; to check if a lock is expired, we must look to see
that either: 1) lockedUntil has passed, or 2) someone else (from another IP 
address, at least) has already acquired the lock (implying that the lock 
expired).

One more thing: transaction rollbacks tend to be expensive (often, an order of
 magnitude more 
expensive than the transaction itself), so a massively concurrent system should
aim to have as few rollbacks as possible. he current behavior should not break anything (specifically, if process A has a lock strictly after process B, then we will never have process A write to the document before process B).
