The stats for N=1, 10, 20 are printed below. Note that for all three cases, 
the thinking time and eating time distributions are the same; this is 
something that doesn't change with the value of N. Hungry times, however, are 
very dependent on the number of clients, since the waiting time increases if
there is a high demand for a single token.
