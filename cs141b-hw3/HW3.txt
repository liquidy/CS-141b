We decided to keep things relatively simple; we have two main columns in our
UI. The left column consists of a list of documents as well as a couple of
buttons for things that can be done directly from the document list view
(e.g. adding a document, refreshing the doc list). At first we had text buttons,
but discovered that it seemed to take up too much space and also wasn't as
elegant as icons on buttons. Similarly, for the buttons on the doc editor in
the right column, we decided to go with a large icon approach that looks more
visually appealing, less cluttered, and reasonably efficient.

One other small UI detail that we intentionally put in is that many of the
actions corresponding to buttons actually block out certain buttons, giving the
user the sense there is an ongoing query. It also gives the user a sense of when
a query has completed, which makes for a more responsive UI.(This could be 
replaced with a progress indicator in the future.)



User feedback:

Caroline:

It's simple (which is good).
The icons are nice.
Probably should unlock the document right after creation.
The orange highlighting when a button is clicked is nice.

Bobo:
